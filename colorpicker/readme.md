# Color Input

A Gio library for color input widgets

## TODO

* The tone of a color is not what is shown under the control of the picker
    * Maybe we need to use the HSL colorspace instead of HSV
    * Maybe the gradient can be drawn differently
* Make the control of the tone and hue picker align to the middle of a mouse event
* Fix issue with size of hue slider when the width in pixels is not a multiple of 6
